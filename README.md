# GLAMhack 2021 Team 17 "Making digitized scores audible"
This site presents the result of the [project Team 17 "Making digitized scores audible" at the GLAMhack 2021](https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/71).

You find the description, how we get the score as digital image into a audible format, in the [project page](https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/71). This website shows what can you do with a music score in the MEI format ([Music Encoding Initiative](https://music-encoding.org/)).
